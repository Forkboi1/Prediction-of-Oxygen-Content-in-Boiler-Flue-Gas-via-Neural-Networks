# ðŸ”¥ Prediction of Oxygen Content in Boiler Flue Gas via Neural Networks

This repository contains the code, data preprocessing steps, and trained model associated with the research paper titled **"Prediction of Oxygen Content in Boiler Flue Gas via Neural Networks."** The work aims to optimize industrial combustion efficiency by accurately predicting oxygen (Oâ‚‚) content in flue gas using machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Accurate prediction of Oâ‚‚ content is essential for controlling air-to-fuel ratios in boilers, thereby improving energy efficiency and reducing pollutant emissions. In this study, a neural network model was developed using historical boiler sensor data to estimate Oâ‚‚ levels with high precision.
